      <p>Keynotes are a new addition to the BMD conference series and we have introduced
them to highlight the work and wisdom of prominent leaders in our field. We are
happy to announce our first keynote talk for BMD 2023: Professor Emeritus
Ichiro Kageyama from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nihon-u.ac.jp/en/">Nihon University</a>. Professor Kageyama has contributed to
significant advances in motorcycle dynamics and control research for over four
decades.</p>

<h2>Title</h2>
<p>The History of Two-wheeled Vehicle Dynamics in Japan and Subsequent Trends</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstract">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Japan had been closed off from the rest of the world for about 220 years until
170 years ago, and as a result, a variety of academic disciplines were
developed independently. For example, in the field of mathematics, using
&quot;Wa-san (Way of Japanese Mathematics)&quot;, Kowa Seki derived a method for finding
solutions to simultaneous equations by the method of elimination 70 years
before Europe. In addition, calculation of π was presented in the 1600s,
showing up to 26 digits by him. Furthermore, there are references to the use of
derivatives in analysis, although the method of expression is different. Thus,
a unique academic culture developed in Japan. However, while it has attracted
attention in Japan as historical research material, its achievements have not
received much attention, and the academic systems established in the western
countries have been emphasized. One of the characteristics of the Japanese
academic system is that many academic discussions, including those in the
engineering field, have been conducted in Japanese due to the environment in
which students can study in Japanese, including reference materials in the
latest academic fields. Therefore, while it has been easy to develop academic
studies in Japan, the language barrier, such as English, has been a major
bottleneck to exchange with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Turning to the motorcycles, the industry expanded rapidly after World War II,
as many companies entered the motorcycle manufacturing business. In response to
this trend, Masaichi Kondo, an aeronautics scholar, conducted vigorous research
activities focusing on the stability and handling of motorcycles and
four-wheeled vehicles. In 1948, the basic equations of motion and steady state
turning characteristics of motorcycles were presented. Later, in 1955, these
were compiled, and the study of motorcycle dynamics was published. From the
mid-1950s to the early 1960s, many experimental and theoretical studies related
to motorcycles were conducted in Japan. As research worthy of attention at the
time, studies on modeling and stabilization of riders operating motorcycles
were already conducted in 1962, using feedback control theory. Later, in the
mid-1960s, more attention was paid to tire characteristics from a dynamics
point of view, and the results of these measurements were also published.
However, most of the research on motorcycles in Japan is difficult to obtain
due to the fact that almost of these were handwritten lecture manuscripts, and
has not received much attention worldwide. For this reason, many researchers
consider the motorcycle dynamics published by Sharp in 1971 as the starting
point for full-scale research on motorcycle dynamics, and in recent years, even
in Japan, many researchers in this field have discussed on the basis of the
equations of motion by Sharp.</p>
<p>Having had the opportunity to give a keynote lecture on motorcycle dynamics at
BMD, I have decided to summarize how research on motorcycle dynamics and
kinematics have developed in Japan and how it has evolved since then, focusing
particularly on research conducted in Japan. In my presentation, I would like
to divide the dynamics of motorcycle kinematics into several areas and show
what research has been done in each of these individual areas.</p>
