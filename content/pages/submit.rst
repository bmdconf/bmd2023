New Proceedings and Review Model
================================

BMD 2023 is partnering with `TU Delft OPEN Publishing`_ so that we can
introduce enhancements to our conference proceedings review and publishing
process as well as finally have a formal proceedings publication. TU Delft OPEN
Publishing is an open access university publisher providing a free-to-publish
model with `Creative Commons`_ licensing, transparent recognition, and no
royalties. The proceedings will be published in their "`The Evolving Scholar`_" open
access journal which is powered by Orvium_, a journal management and publishing
software.

This partnership provides these enhancements:

- Peer reviewed and archived abstracts and papers (DOIs issued for both)
- Published and indexed open access conference proceedings (`prior examples`_)
- We will be part of the The Evolving Scholar powered by Orvium project and
  receive review and publishing support
- `Open peer review`_ process powered by Orvium software
- Conference community platform powered by Orvium for announcements,
  submission, reviews, and online interaction

See below for details on submitting your abstracts and papers.

Abstracts
=========

If you would like to present your work at the conference, you must submit an
abstract of maximum 2 pages that describes the research you wish to present by
February 28, 2023 [23:59 UTC]. Please state clear objectives, results, and
conclusions and cite applicable references.

You must use the provided templates and submit your abstract as an ``.odt``,
``.docx``, or ``.zip`` file containing the LaTeX source files to our Orvium
Community. Your "preprint" abstract will be publicly viewable on Orvium_ after
a editorial check. Following submission, your abstract will be reviewed by the
scientific committee and ranked for relevance and quality for inclusion in the
conference.  The anonymized reviewer comments will be publicly viewable as part
of our `open peer review`_ process.

Based on the reviews, your abstract will be either accepted and selected for a
podium or a poster presentation or it will be rejected. The organizing
committee will make all final decisions based on topical fit, scientific
committee reviews, and conference capacity.

For accepted abstracts, you will be required to revise your abstract based on
the reviews and submit a final version by June 30, 2023 [23:59 UTC]. The
revised version will be printed in the book of abstracts as well as published
in the final conference proceedings alongside the papers. Major content updates
to the extended abstracts will be rejected, please only apply formatting
corrections, clarifications, and technical soundness improvements.

Presentations
=============

If your abstract is accepted you will be assigned to either a 15 minute oral
presentation (+5 min Q&A) or a poster presentation. Oral presenters will have
access to a standard projection screen for showing slides. Your poster will be
attached to a poster board on the first conference day and visible for the
duration of the conference and during the poster session.

Papers
======

All accepted authors may optionally submit a paper of length 6-12 pages which
expands on your abstract by September 15, 2023 [23:59 UTC]. This paper will
undergo a post-conference peer review and, if the paper passes the review by a
to-be-announced deadline, it will be published in the conference proceedings
book. The papers (all versions) and their anonymized reviews will be available
publicly on the `The Evolving Scholar`_ powered by Orvium_ `conference
community page`_ for the conference as well as during and after the review
process.

Published Proceedings
=====================

The proceedings (revised abstracts and peer reviewed papers) will be formally
published as an online open access book by `TU Delft OPEN Publishing`_. The
book will be assigned an ISBN/ISSN, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and be
indexed by services such as Google Scholar, the `Directory of Open Access
Books`_, and OpenAire_.

Copyright
=========

Authors will retain copyright to all versions of their abstracts and papers but
will be required to grant a CC-BY 4.0 License to `TU Delft OPEN Publishing`_
and the Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference for the purposes of sharing
and publishing the abstracts and papers. Similarly, reviewers retain copyright
to their reviews but grant a CC-BY 4.0 License for display on the `The Evolving
