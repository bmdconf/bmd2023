   Van Lunteren and Stassen's 1967 TU Delft Bicycle Simulator.

Several bicycle and motorcycle simulators have been developed and validated but
only a few studies actually applied these simulators in training and in
research. We organize an informal workshop before the BMD conference to discuss
and align on lessons learned in:

1. mechanical motion cuing, visual motion cuing, usage of body motion, vehicle
   modelling, rendering of steering forces, propulsion and braking, the
   resulting behavioral validity in vehicle control, perceived realism and
   motion sickness.
2. traffic interaction, and behavioral validity in interaction

We invite developers and users to join this informal workshop. Those who wish
to present can submit an abstract of at most 250 words, preferably with an
image of the simulator.

An agenda will be composed depending on the submissions.

We also aim to organize demonstrations of simulators at the actual conference
as part of the exhibitions.

The workshop will focus on lessons learned and unresolved questions.
Another goal of the workshop is to move towards agreement on quality measures
for 2-wheeler simulators, and towards unified experimental protocols to assess
performance.

It is fine to also present research results at the actual conference.

Abstracts for the workshop can be submitted to Linda van der Spaa by email
(L.F.vanderSpaa@tudelft.nl) before March 7, 2023 (extended from February 28,
2023).
