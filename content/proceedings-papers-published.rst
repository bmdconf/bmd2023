Now that the open peer review process has concluded, we are happy to announce
that we have accepted and published **28 peer reviewed conference papers**
resulting from the work of the presenters and authors at the 2023 Bicycle and
Motorcycle Dynamics Conference. Congratulations to all authors! We are grateful
for the work of all the anonymous reviewers, the editors, and both the TU Delft
OPEN Publishing team and the Orvium team to make this all happen.

All papers and their associated reviews can be viewed on the `Orvium BMD
Community Page`_:

Each published paper will have either two or three versions, depending whether
there was one round of peer review or two. The peer reviews for each version
can be accessed in the right panel or the "REVIEWS" tab and the author's
response to the reviews can be found under the "FILES" tab.

We are busy preparing the proceedings book made up of presented abstracts and
all conference papers. Look for an announcement about it in the near future.
