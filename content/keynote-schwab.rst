Title
=====

Bicycle Dynamics and Control: A 'Sleeping Beauty'

Abstract
========

In this presentation I will briefly look back at 125 years of research on
bicycle dynamics and control. After which I will quickly move on to more timely
questions and problems in cycling research.

Biography
=========

Dr. Schwab is the founder of the TUDelft Bicycle Lab and has been running that
until my recent retirement from TUDelft. I'm in theoretical and applied
mechanics and I teach mechanics and multibody dynamics. I am interested in
Dynamics of Mechanical Systems, the so-called Multibody Dynamics. In particular
the treatment of contact phenomena like in collisions and rolling
(non-holonomic constraints) have my special interest. I also know more or less
about dynamics of flexible multibody system, finite element method,
biomechanics, legged locomotion, speed skating and bicycle dynamics and rider
control. My degrees are from Engineering at Dordrecht (BSc 1979) and at Delft
(MSc 1983, PhD 2002).
